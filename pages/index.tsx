        I&apos;m a Front-end Developer who started this journey about 4 years
        ago. in addition to working with all the concepts and tools in this

        Outside of programming, I enjoy traveling. Iran is a wonderful country
        to travel. From the forests and the beautiful sea in the north of the

        areas in the west and the warm land and lovely people with delicious
        foods in the south.
