        ago. in addition to working with all the concepts and tools in this
        field, I really enjoy working and learning more and more
        JavaScript/TypeScript topics.

        Outside of programming, I enjoy traveling. Iran is a wonderful country
        to travel. From the forests and the beautiful sea in the north of the
        country, the unique deserts in the center, the attractive mountainous
        areas in the west and the warm land and lovely people with delicious
        foods in the south.
